 👋 Hi, I’m @Ccellis7777
- 😄 I'm a technical writer who's here to learn more about GitHub and have fun writing code!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an avid golfer 🏌🏻‍♀️⛳️

I have over 20 years of experience in creating software documentation in a Docs-as-Code, DevOps environment for SaaS applications. I enjoy creating API documentation and doc for highly technical topics! I've used Git/Github to collaborate with development teams and technical writers around the globe.
